# 3D_Optical_Flow
### This is the final project for MSR at Northwestern University
### Project Goal

The project is focused on using a rgbd camera(Intel Realsense D435i) to capture an object with random motion. By capturing the pointcloud at consecutive timestamps and giving a groundtruth motion, the deep learning model is able to learn the sub-piexl motion(less than 5mm). The whole project is simulation based using ROS and Gazebo.
